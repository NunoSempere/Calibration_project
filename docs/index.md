[Here](https://nunosempere.github.io/calibration/prediction_explainer.pdf) is a short document explaining the idea of a prediction markets.

[Here](http://www.gwern.net/Prediction-markets) is a longer read by Gwern, an author I admire.

He uses PredictionBook.com, whereas I've written my own software, available and tweakable in a Github repository: [Calibration](https://github.com/NunoSempere/calibration), partly because I like to make predictions about, f.ex., whether two of my friends are going to break up.
