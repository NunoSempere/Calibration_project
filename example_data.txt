I am able to press 50 pushups; 2; F; 6/7/2018; also made a bet with Vlad Firoiu.

// The format of a prediction is:

// Statement of the prediction. It can be longish, but not too long: if you want to change this go to constants.h -> MAX_STATEMENT.
// ;
// credence, in my example it was 2%, so I wrote 2.
// ;
// The state of a prediction, which can be:
// T: true, the thing came to pass.
// F: false, the thing did not come to pass
// U: Undecided.
// ;
// date, in format day/month/year.
// some additional comments.

// The ';' are important, because they tell when one part ends and another begins

// Lines which start with a "//" are comments. This is a comment

// This is another comment. Note that I can leave empty lines as long as they don't cut up predictions.

// This is another prediction:

An AGI will be created in 2019; 1; U; 1/7/2019; also made bet with Jaime Sevilla.

// I actually thing the probability is <<1%, but at the moment, my program discriminates only between percentages.
// That is, you can only write predictions from 1% to 99%, which take integer values.
// Note that the prediction is undecided, so the date written is when the prediction is resolved.
