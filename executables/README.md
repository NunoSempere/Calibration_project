# These here are executables.

Hey Q, oh great first user!  
You shouldn't in general download random execultables from the internet.  
You can instead have a look at the source files at calibration/src and compile them yourself  
At any point, there are three executable files in this folder:  
- calibration: for Linux users  
- calibration-windows-32-bit.exe: for Windows users with 32 bit (old) processors.  
- calibration-windows-64-bit.exe: for Windows users with 64 bit (newer) processors. You probably want this.  

You want to put the program somewhere, for example in a folder named "folder".  
In the same folder create a file, assumed to be "data.txt", but which can have any other name.   

In it, write predictions of the form:  
Prediction; probabilty; ourcome; date; comments.

I am able to press 50 pushups; 2; F; 6/7/2018; also made a bet with Vlad Firoiu.  

See the file example_data for more details.
